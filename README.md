# linear_regression_optimization

This Python script performs optimization for linear regression using gradient descent. It generates random data points, initializes bias and weight values, and iteratively updates them to minimize the mean squared error. The optimization process is visualized using contour plots

# Usage

Install the required dependencies.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
The script uses gradient descent to find the optimal bias and weight values for a linear regression model. The optimization process is visualized with contour plots, showing the convergence of the parameters.
